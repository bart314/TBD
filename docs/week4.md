# 4. Us and Them

> The idea of a sociological organism moving calendrically through homogenous, empty time is a precise analogue of the idea of the nation, which also is conceived as a solid community moving steadily down (or up) history.  (Anderson, 1983, 26)

## Introduction: Relations and Rituals

During this session, we talk about *groups*, *communities*, *societies*. Why is it that we feel ourselves connected with some (group of) people and not with others, why do the things we do or like *resonate* with some people and not with others?

We will look into the role *stories* and *rituals* play in creating bondings between people – on different levels, on different time-scales and on different locations. Following Hartmut Rosa, we will introduce the concept of *horizontal*, *vertical* and *diagonal* resonance-axis and the role these play in world-opening.

=== "DE"

    Tatsächlich liegt hier eine elementare Funktion des Ritus verborgen: Rituale stiften soziokulturell etablierte Resonanzachsen, entlang deren *vertikale* (zu Göttern, zum Kosmos, zur Zeit und zur Ewigkeit), *horizontale* (in der sozialen Gemeinschaft) und *diagonale* (auf die Dinge bezogene) Resonanzbeziehungen erfahrbar werden. (Rosa, 2022, p.297)

=== "EN"
    
    Here in fact lies one of the elementary functions of *ritual*. Rituals establish sociocultural axes of resonance along which may be experienced three different kinds of resonant relationship: *vertical* (e.g. to the gods, the cosmos, time, or eternity), *horizontal* (within one's social community), and *diagonal* (with respect to things). (Rosa, 2019, p.173)

## Practical exercise

In this session, we are going to make a few groups (three or four, depending on the number of participants). Each of this group is asked to create a group identity, including (but not limited to) narratives, rituals, ways of being-in-the-world.

After this creational phase, the groups are invited to investigate how they *relate* to each other – as if they were on a voyage of discovery and came across other cultures.

## Textual exercises

__Part 1: Reading__

Go over the materials you can find on [*The Brave Toaster*](https://ourenglishclass.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/09/bravetoaster.pdf) by [Cory Doctorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow). This is a small introduction into particular key moments that you can find in all kinds of narratives. See if you can identify the following parts: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Make these parts known in the text, e.g. by marking them with a circle.

Have a look at [this prezi-presentation](https://prezi.com/p/zwqi9vkher0m/the-brave-little-toaster-stages-of-plot/) about the same article, or see [this study material on Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/study-guides/summary-of-the-brave-little-toaster-81f8acba-0e69-48fe-b378-09d66569177c).

The processed text will be part of your exercises book. 

__Part 2: Writing__

Write a speculative Science Fiction Story yourself, about how the future could be given the state and development of current technologies (you can use *The Brave Toaster* as inspiration). Again, use the parts mentioned  (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) in your story.

Come up with a captivating first sentence (remember the [*suspention of disbelief*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) from [last week's](files/3.fact-fiction.pdf) presentation) and elaborate the remainder in the form of a *story board*.
