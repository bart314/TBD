# 4. Us and Them

> The idea of a sociological organism moving calendrically through homogenous, empty time is a precise analogue of the idea of the nation, which also is conceived as a solid community moving steadily down (or up) history.  

– Benedict Anderson

## Introduction: Relations and Rituals

During this session, we talk about *groups*, *communities*, *societies*. Why is it that we feel ourselves connected with some (group of) people and not with others, why do the things we do or like *resonate* with some people and not with others?

We will look into the role *stories* and *rituals* play in creating bondings between people – on different levels, on different time-scales and on different locations. Following Hartmut Rosa, we will introduce the concept of *horizontal*, *vertical* and *diagonal* resonance-axis and the role these play in world-opening.

=== "DE"

    Tatsächlich liegt hier eine elementare Funktion des Ritus verborgen: Rituale stiften soziokulturell etablierte Resonanzachsen, entlang deren *vertikale* (zu Göttern, zum Kosmos, zur Zeit und zur Ewigkeit), *horizontale* (in der sozialen Gemeinschaft) und *diagonale* (auf die Dinge bezogene) Resonanzbeziehungen erfahrbar werden. (Rosa, 2022, p.297)

=== "EN"
    
    Here in fact lies one of the elementary functions of *ritual*. Rituals establish sociocultural axes of resonance along which may be experienced three different kinds of resonant relationship: *vertical* (e.g. to the gods, the cosmos, time, or eternity), *horizontal* (within one's social community), and *diagonal* (with respect to things). (Rosa, 2019, p.173)

## Practical exercise

In this session, we are going to make a few groups (three or four, depending on the number of participants). Each of this group is asked to create a group identity, including (but not limited to) narratives, rituals, ways of being-in-the-world.

After this creational phase, the groups are invited to investigate how they *relate* to each other – as if they were on a voyage of discovery and came across other cultures.

## Textual exercises

__Part 1: Reading__

Read the chapter *Skywoman Falling* from the book [*Braiding Sweetgrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braiding_Sweetgrass) by [Robin Wall Kimmerer](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/kimmerer/). We have [provided a pdf that you can download here](files/Kimmerer-Skywoman-Falling.pdf) (or [here in Dutch 🇳🇱](files/Kimmerer-SkywomanDutch.pdf)). 

Again, read the text closely and critically. As you go, process the text: annotate by jotting down questions or comments in the margins, underlining important points, circling keywords, and marking places you may want to revisit. Feel free to underline, scribble, or doodle. 

The processed text will be part of your exercises book. 

__Part 2: Writing__

The writing exercise will de done during class.
