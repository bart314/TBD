# 3. Fact and Fiction

## Introduction: Narratives and Mediation

## Preperation

For this week's practical exercise, we want you to bring an object to class. This should be a practical object you *like* to use, and use on a more or less daily basis. It should, however, *not* (or not per se) have a *sentimental value* for you. So you could e.g. bring a hammer that you like to work with, but not the hammer that you got from your father for your eighteenth birthday.
