# 2. Time and Space

> Fijne quote hier, Bergson misschien, of Kant?

## Introduction: Temporalities

Design, art and technology have always influenced our relation with time and space â€“ not only our *conception* of time and space, but the very phenomenon. We will look at several issues with time and space that are related to our being as a species, and analyze their consequences in our contemporary society.

We start off with the 'emergence' of space at the end of the paleolithic, when we contrast the wall paintings at Lascaux with big stone monuments found at southern Turkey. We will hear an echo of this emergence when we look at the way mechanical clocks started to find their way in society. And at the end, we will investigate whether these phenomenons are momentarily repeated in the virtual realm.

In the course of this session, we will discuss the way rituals bring structure to time in the same way buildings bring structure in space. We will introduce a difference between clock-time and felt-time and relate that to the phenomenon of memory. Time is something in the happening...

## Assignment: a sense of time

In the theoretical part, we looked at the analysis of non-places by [Zygmunt Bauman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Bauman) in his [Liquid Modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_modernity). If you think carefully, all of these four non-spaces have a specific kind of time-perception. You tend to vacate the inhospitible as quickly as possible, while you know exactly how long your training at the gym will take. You need to be at the airport on time, while you don't know about the time perception of the suburbs you never visit.

All this results in the following nice summary:

name | example | time sense
---|---|---
The inhospitible | office buildings | vacate quickly
The non-interactive | the gym | fixed duration
The no-where | airport | be on time
The empty | the suburb | no time

In this assignment, you are asked to change a specific and concrete non-place into a civil (inviting, meaningful) public space. 

- Come up with a specific concrete non-place and make clear what kind of non-place this is and why.
- Come up with a work (a small installation which forms an addition to the place) that will change this particular place into a *civil* space.
- Realise this work in a *proof-of-concept*-manner (so it doesn't have to be completely finished and polished).
