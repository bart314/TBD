# 2. Time and Space

> Le temps est invention, ou il n’est rien du tout.

## Introduction: Temporalities

In this session, we will look into the phenomena of *Time* and *Space*. We will see that you can look at both of them in (at least) a mathematical and in a phenomenological sense, that there is an inherent friction between those ways of seeing, and that interesting things start to happen when you make this friction explicit.

Time as well as space have a tendency to *flow*: we are living in a time-space continuum and it seems as though there is no escaping this fundamental property of human existence. On the face of it, time and space seem indifferent to human existence.

However, this more mathematical form of time and space, this *isotrope* and *isochrone* ways of experience, doesn't resonate with the way we humans actually experience time or space. When standing in a plank-position, a minute will feel actually quite long, while on the other hand if you are watching an interesting movie the hours will pass without you actually noticing it.

When you are driving over a highway, you probably don't differentiate one view from another. But when you are suddently confronted with a monument, erected to commemorate someone who had an accident there, that particular place stands out from all the other points of the highway. The monument differentiates that place from all the other places of the highway.

We will talk about the way buildings form space in the same way that rituals form time. We follow Martin Heidegger's lead, when he states that mankind *is* only in so far as we *build*:

=== "DE"

    Der Bezug des Menschen zu Orten und durcht Orte zu Räumen beruht im Wohnen. Das Verhältnis von Mensch und Raum ist nichts anderes als das wesentlich gedachten Wohnen. (Heidegger, 2000, p. 160)

=== "EN"

    Man’s relation to locales, and through locales to spaces, inheres in his dwelling. The relationship between man and space is none other than *dwelling*, thought essentially. (Heidegger, 2008, p. 159)

## Practical exercise

In this week's exercise, you are asked to work in duo's, go outside (of the classroom) and locate a particular space (and come up with the experience of time at that place). Next, you need to create some kind of intervention to change the (perception of) space and (the perception) of time.

## Writing exercise

__Part 1__

Read ["Clocks, The Scent of Time" (chapter 15 of McLuhan's *Understanding Media*, McLuhan (1964))](files/mcluhan-clock.pdf). Use the knowledge, insights and vocabulary that we have conveyed during this class to put this text in a broader context.

Again, read the text closely and critically. As you go, process the text: annotate by jotting down questions or comments in the margins, underlining important points, circling keywords, and marking places you may want to revisit. Feel free to underline, scribble, or doodle. 

The processed text will be part of your exercises book. 

__Part 2__

Using your experience of the practical assignment, please write a *comparison/contrast essay* in which you compare the situation (in space, in time) *before* and *after* your intervention.

- Describe what you are going to investigate.
- Describe what the space was like *before* the intervention.
- Describe what the space was like *after* the intervention (use reactions of your fellow-student).
- Compare the two. Has the experience of space and time changed?
- Use text, photos and/or video's
