# Assessment and learning outcomes


## Assignments

For every session, an assignment is given on which you works on an individual basis. The format of the result of this assignment is given at the assignment itself. After the plenary discussions, you need to refine your elaborations and provide a critical reflection on them.

## Portfolio

On top of their elaborations from the weekly assignments, you are required to come up with more non-trivial examples of each of the subject (most notably from artists and designers, but perhaps also everyday examples). You also need to make explicit why this is an example of this particular subject.

Apart from that, you need to make clear you have actually read the mandatory reading assignments, using (for example but not limitted to) notes, markings or illustrations on the provided texts.

This way, at the end of the term, you will have created a *portfolio*. This portfolio will be assessed from a theoretical viewpoint, both artistically and philosophically. 

Is the portfolio __complete__? Does it contain answers to the questions that were raised during the module?

Is the portfolio __thorough__? Do the answers prove to be interesting, complete, thorough, detailed, ...?

Is the portfolio __creative__? Does it contain creative and novel ideas and insights?

Is the portfolio __convincing__? Do the works and the texts gathers in the portfolio actually make sense?

Feedback on the portfolio will be given at particular times during the module, so make sure that you work on it from the first day (and don't wait untill the last).

## Active participation

Apart from the eighty-percent rule, you also need to be active during the class. This includes (but is not limited to) being *present* during the theoretical part (making notes etc.), being *active* during the individual elaborations (actually working etc.), and being *engaged* during the discussions (asking questions etc.). 

We will take notes on the participation of each of the students and will try to make sure everybody gets the opportunity to make themself heard.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. __Describe and reflect upon their own relationship to the world as makers and observers__, in terms of self/other, world/reality, and the materiality of time and space.

2. __Communicate their findings and insights clearly and thoughtfully__, in a way that invites dialogue rather than just transmission.

3. __Find different kinds of sources__ (visual, textual, auditory, experiential, artistic) relevant to their artistic practice.

4. __Demonstrate the ability to critically interpret and contextualize resources__, and situating them within broader cultural, social, or historical frameworks.

5. __Develop a personal artistic or theoretical position in relation to selected sources__, expressing this in writing, visual form, or time-based media.


## Competences

__Level Orientation (semester 1-2):__
The student shows insight into the nature of the profession and the tasks, and sensitivity and potential for the continued acquisition of the competences.

__Research and Reflection:__
The student is able to critically and from multiple perspectives consider their own work and working method and that of others. This allows the student to deepen their own design or artistry, make it more layered and position.

The student has a curious, inquisitive, and entrepreneurial attitude towards other perspectives, work practices, and ways of thinking. By sharing findings with fellow students and with the professional field, the student also questions their own ways of thinking, working methods, work and positioning.
