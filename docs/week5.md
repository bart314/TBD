## Textual excercise
__Part 1: Reading__

Go over the materials you can find on [*The Brave Toaster*](https://ourenglishclass.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/09/bravetoaster.pdf) by [Cory Doctorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow). This is a small introduction into particular key moments that you can find in all kinds of narratives. See if you can identify the following parts: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Make these parts known in the text, e.g. by marking them with a circle.

Have a look at [this prezi-presentation](https://prezi.com/p/zwqi9vkher0m/the-brave-little-toaster-stages-of-plot/) about the same article, or see [this study material on Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/study-guides/summary-of-the-brave-little-toaster-81f8acba-0e69-48fe-b378-09d66569177c).

The processed text will be part of your exercises book. 

__Part 2: Writing__

Write a speculative Science Fiction Story yourself, about how the future could be given the state and development of current technologies (you can use *The Brave Toaster* as inspiration). Again, use the parts mentioned  (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) in your story.

Come up with a captivating first sentence (remember the [*suspention of disbelief*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) from [last week's](files/3.fact-fiction.pdf) presentation) and elaborate the remainder in the form of a *story board*. Writing exercise
