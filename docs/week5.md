# 5. Presence and Absence

> Humans are bringers-forth; through their activity, they guide means of life into presence; they are poetic beings. Humans have ideas, and that to such an extent that their producing is in the first place and essentially an imagining of sights, of ideas. 

– Michael Eldred

## Introduction: The narrative

## Practical exercise

For the practical exercise of this week, we ask you to bring a commercial poster to class – a poster that communicates its convincing message very clear and immediate. The poster should contain both text and images. It is necessary that you bring this poster phyisically (so either a real poster, or a print of one).
