## Introduction: Umwelt

What language do the things of the world speak, that we might come to an understanding with them? To be sure, we don't know the world's language, or rather we know only the various animistic, religious or mathematical versions of it. In fact, the Earth speaks to us in terms of forces, bonds and interactions, and that's enough to make a contract.

That's how the French philosopher [Michel Serres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Serres) sees the interaction between the human and the non-human – a division that, according to [Dorothee Kimmich](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/philosophische-fakultaet/fachbereiche/neuphilologie/deutsches-seminar/abteilungen/neuere-deutsche-literatur/mitarbeitende/prof-dr-dorothee-kimmich/), is relevant "only for modern, adult human beings". According to her, "Children, people from 'premodern' cultures, and the insane have no problem with living things". 

We humans are unable to [transcend our human point of view](https://themarkaz.org/beyond-our-gaze-rethinking-animals-in-contemporary-art/), just as our cat is unable to transcend ours. We can study as much as we want about the perceptive system of any animal, but [what is it like to be a bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F) will forever remain closed to us.

Every animal that has ever lived, every species that has ever existed, has come into being as a result of a particular and specific fine-tuned relationship with a particular and fine-tuned environment. As [Louise Barrett](https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/advanced-study/about-us/staff/2024-25-fellows/professor-louise-barrett/) has pointed out, "[In] order for an individual to produce species-typical behavior, it must also inherit an environment similar to that of previous generations as well as similar genes, and it must not undergo a similar developmental process."

In order to describe this particular relationship between an organism and environment, the Baltic-German biologist [Jakob von Uexküll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Johann_von_Uexk%C3%BCll) coined the term [*Umwelt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt). Uexküll argued that organisms experience life in terms of species-specific, spatio-temporal, "self-in-world" subjective reference frames that he called Umwelt (which can be translated as surrounding-world, phenomenal world, self-world, environment, ...).

All this is relevant for Time Based design and art, as it calls into question the way we *perceive* the works that we create. Actually, can we make art for non-human animals...?


## Preperation
1. Think about (or actually; from the perspective of) an animal that is constantly mis-understood. For example an octopus that has a completely different form of intelligence than we have, a cow or a bog brought to the slaughterhous, or a wolve that is seen as a big dangerous animal.

2. During the reces, try to find something (art, design, ...) that is mundane in your vicinity but would be remarkable in another (e.g. a commercial that makes perfect sense in your country but would be very strange to see in The Netherlands). Take it (or a photograph of it) with you the this session.

## Practical exercise

In this exercise, we are going to *experience* different *Umwelts*.

1. Choose a __perspective__: a non-human animal, a human with some impairments, a technical system.
2. Define the __Umwelt__: what does *exist* in this Umwel? What is perceivable and what remains hidden, what triggers reactions or interactions?
3. Create a __representation__: create an artwork that enacts this Umwelt, e.g. a small video, a short performance, a strange interaction.
4. Plenary __presentation__: we will show some of the results, on basis of which the group needs to come up with what (kind of) Umwelt is being represented.

!!! Warning "No text"
    Please note that in your elaboration you are not allowed to use text or icons: the Umwelt must be *felt*, not *explained*.

## Writing exercise
__Part 1: reading__
Read [the essay about the wolf from Eva Meijer](files/the-wolf-is-not-angry.pdf) (or [here in Dutch](files/de-wolf-is-niet-boos.pdf)). As always, read the text closely and critically. As you go, process the text: annotate by jotting down questions or comments in the margins, underlining important points, circling keywords, and marking places you may want to revisit. Feel free to underline, scribble, or doodle. 

Again, the processed text will be part of your exercises book. 

__Part 2: writing__
Imagine that you are writing a letter (of about one page) to a newspaper from the perspective of the wolf, who has a bad reputation in the current debate about wolves. 

There are voices calling for more wolves to be killed, and other even want to eradicate the species entirely.

Try to write from the wolf's point of view, based on what you know about the animal – a letter in which you, as a wolf, try to foster understanding for your own place in living alongside humans.
