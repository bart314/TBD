## Introduction: 

## Practical exercise

## Writing exercise
__Part 1: reading__
Read [the essay about the wolf from Eva Meijer](files/the-wolf-is-not-angry.pdf) (or [here in Dutch](files/de-wolf-is-niet-boos.pdf)). As always, read the text closely and critically. As you go, process the text: annotate by jotting down questions or comments in the margins, underlining important points, circling keywords, and marking places you may want to revisit. Feel free to underline, scribble, or doodle. 

The processed text will be part of your exercises book. 

__Part 2: writing__
Imagine that you are writing a letter (of about one page) to a newspaper from the perspective of the wolf, who has a bad reputation in the current debate about wolves. 

There are voices calling for more wolves to be killed, and other even want to eradicate the species entirely.

Try to write from the wolf's point of view, based on what you know about the animal â€“ a letter in which you, as a wolf, try to foster understanding for your own place in living alongside humans.
