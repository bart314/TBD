# General introduction

## Summary

When we look at [the description of this module](https://www.academieminerva.nl/en/programmes/design/majors/time-based
), we read the following:

=== "EN"
    You learn to work as a designer with objects, moving images and light to tell stories. You do so within the context of theatre, film, events and public space, for example, in stagings, choreographies and video clips. You will gain experience working independently and in teams on large and small productions, often working with professional organizations. 

    By working with space, time and body, you discover polarities such as inside/outside and appearance/reality. In your process, you learn to create an archive of materials, experiment and execute your design. You will eventually find your own place in this discipline, where both your way of working and the context in which you do so fit what fascinates you.

=== "NL"
    Je leert als ontwerper werken met objecten, bewegende beelden en licht om verhalen te kunnen vertellen. Dat doe je binnen de context van bijvoorbeeld theater, film, evenementen en openbare ruimte, in ensceneringen, choreografieën en videoclips. Je doet zelfstandig en in teams ervaring op met het werken aan grote en kleine producties waarbij je vaak samenwerkt met professionele organisaties. 

    Door te werken met ruimte, tijd en lichaam ontdek je polariteiten als binnen/buiten en schijn/werkelijkheid. In je proces leer een archief van materialen aan te leggen, te experimenteren en je ontwerp uit te voeren. Je vindt uiteindelijk je eigen plek in deze discipline, waarbij zowel je manier van werken als de context waarin je dat doet passen bij wat jou fascineert. 

When we tell stories, we *create a world* in which that story takes place. Every narrative, even the smallest one, transposes the listener to the world that is *opened* throught that narrative: a world that has its own *time*, its own *space*, and its own *logic() and *internal consistency*.

In this module, we investigate this world-opening. Specifically, we are interested in our *relation to the world*. We look at different perspectives and different aspects of this relation, create different experiments to make this relation explicit, and try to make different kinds of worlds. 

Our goal is to impart a good theoretical basis of the key-words of the module: story-telling, space, time, body, etc. Having a thorough theoretical understanding of this *world-opening* and our *relationship with the world* will help you in creating an interesting and engaging narrative within your own artistic practice.

## Educational structure

This module consists of seven sessions of hundredfifty minutes each. Every session is build around a central aspect of the *world-opening*. We start with a small theoretical exposé on that aspect, after which an assignment is given on which the students will works on an individual basis for about an hour – the form of the results of this work vary and are given at the assignment. After this hour, we reconvene and use the remaining time to discuss the results.

Every week, every aspect of the module has its own page on this small website. This page contains a general introduction, a description of the assignment, examples, keywords and literature. Some of the literature is mandatory reading, other literature is given as extra background-information. We expect students to prepare for every session by going over the assignment and reading the mandatory literature.

Students should keep track of their preparations, their elaborations of the assignments and the text they have read. Apart from this, they should look for other examples of designers or artists that resonate with the subject of that week. The bundle of this preperations, aided and abetted by their own reflection, forms the portfolio on which this module is graded. Please [have a look at the assessment and learning outcomes](assessment.md) for a more detailed overview.

## Formal issues

This is a 3EC module, which means the total workload is 84 hours (3 &times; 28). Given seven sessions of 2.5 hours each, this leads to the following table:

description | calculation | workload
---|---|---
7 sessions of 2.5 hours | 7 &times; 2.5 | 17.5
7 times preperation | 7 &times; 1 | 7.0
Total home study | - | 59.0

This means that students are expected to work around six hours per week on their portfolio.

As is described in [the OER (§5.2, login required)](https://hanzenl.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/sites/bmnc_binf_ps_mijnhanze/Onderwijsportaal/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fbmnc%5Fbinf%5Fps%5Fmijnhanze%2FOnderwijsportaal%2FWeten%20en%20Regelen%2FStart%20van%20studie%28jaar%29%2FOverzicht%20Onderwijs%20en%20Examenregeling%2FSABK%2FVormgeving%2F20241211%20OER%20Academie%20Minerva%20bachelor%20Vormgeving%202024%2D25%20def%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Fbmnc%5Fbinf%5Fps%5Fmijnhanze%2FOnderwijsportaal%2FWeten%20en%20Regelen%2FStart%20van%20studie%28jaar%29%2FOverzicht%20Onderwijs%20en%20Examenregeling%2FSABK%2FVormgeving), students are required to be present at least eighty percent of the time. This leads to a total of 5.6 sessions on which students must participate. This can be be either *floored* to 5 or *ceiled* to 6, depending on the participation of the students and such to the judgement of the teacher.

- If possible, the student reports any absence beforehand (via [e-mail](b.barnard@pl.hanze.nl)).
- In the case of being absent too many times, the student’s performance will be regarded as ‘not assessable’.
- A 'not assessable' result is recorded by the teacher(s) on the assessment form with a 'GK’ (Gemiste Kans = missed opportunity); this will also be registered in Osiris.

## Notes on the use of AI

We expect you to use AI (ChatGPT and image generation tools, at a minimum) in this module; in fact, some assignments will require it. Learning to use AI is an emerging skill and we will provide tutorials about how to do this in an efficient and interesting way.

Be aware of the limits of ChatGPT and likely techniques:

- If you provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low quality results. You will need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This will take work.

- Don't believe *anything* it says. If it gives you facts, assume them to be wrong and make sure you check them in some other way or reference. You will be responsible for any errors or omissions provided by the tool.

- AI is a tool, but one that you need to acknowledge using. Please include a paragraph at the end of your portfolio that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you provided it with. 

- Be thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don't use it if it isn't appropriate for the case or for the circumstances.
