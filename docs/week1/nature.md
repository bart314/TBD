# Nature is what we see

'Nature' is what we see —<br>
The Hill — the Afternoon —<br>
Squirrel — Eclipse — the Bumble bee —<br>
<br>
Nay — Nature is Heaven —<br>
Nature is what we hear —<br>
The Bobolink — the Sea —<br>
Thunder — the Cricket —<br>
<br>
Nay — Nature is Harmony —<br>
Nature is what we know —<br>
<br>
Yet have no art to say —<br>
So impotent Our Wisdom is<br>
To her Simplicity.<br>
<br>
– Emily Dickenson (1830 - 1886)
