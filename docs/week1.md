# 1. World and Reality

> Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist


## Introduction: Resonance

When we look around in our world, we encounter a lot of stuff in it: chairs, telephones, planes, trains, or automobiles. However, this stuff *means* something to us: we can use a chair to sit on, or a train to get from A to B.

However, apart from this more functional meaning, the stuff we encounter also has a particula meaning *for* us: my telephone means something to me, as yours does to you. However, the meaning I attach to my telephone is (in all likelihood) *different* from the meaning you attach to yours.

And it is probable that you have some stuff that only has a *meaning*, a *significance* for you, like a stone you picked up when you were a kid, some poster or design you created when you were a juvenile. Or there are things that mean something to you and to people like you, or you gravitate towards (kind of) people that attach (kind of) the same significance to the same (kind of) objects...

All this leads us to conclude that the world we experience is something different than the object we encounter in it. In this first session, we are going to investigate the way this works. In so doing, we will look into *resonance* as a meaningful way of relating to the world.

## Practical exercise

In the practical exercise you are asked to think about the way you interact with the things when commuting to the academy. We will take four (or five) steps to analyse this interaction and eventually distill one central term out of it. 


## Writing exercise

After the practical exercise you (hopefully) will have a particular view on how you relate to the world. We have introduced a term to describe this relation and we have discussed quite intensively on its definition. In this writing exercise, you are asked to come up with a *freeform* definition of 'Resonance'. 

Take *ten minutes* to write a text according to the six points below. The basic unit of this practice is the timed exercise. Time yourself for ten minutes and commit yourself to those ten minutes and for that full period.

1.	Keep your hand moving. (Don't pause to reread the line you have just written. That's stalling and trying to get control of what you're saying.)
2.	Don’t cross out. (That is editing as you write. Even if you write something you didn't mean to write, leave it.)
3.	Don’t worry about spelling, punctuation, grammar. (Don't even care about staying within the margins and lines on the page.)
4.	Lose control.
5.	Don’t think. Don’t get logical.
6.	Go for the jugular. (If something comes up in your writing that is scary or naked, dive right into it. It probably has lots of energy.)

Next time, we will use this text as input for an editing-exercise, so be sure to take it with you to the next class.
