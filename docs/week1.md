# 1. World and Reality

> Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist


## Introduction: Frame of Experience

When we go around our daily business, we interact with reality, with the *things around us*. When we, for example, take the bus to the academy, we lean against the lamppost while we doom-scroll over our telephone and wait for the bus to arrive. When we see the bus coming around the corner, we put away our telephone, take out our card, and signal the driver that we want to get in. We use the machine to check in, walk to the nearest free chair and sit down, put our back on the chair next to us, get out our phone again and continue doom-scrolling.

Most of these interactions are done without much conscious thought. We don't *think* about the lamppost when we lean against it, we *just do it*. We don't necessary *think* about the action of checking in; instead, we say hello to the driver and mind the person in front of us â€“ an absent-mindedness that sometimes results in questions like 'did I check in or not ðŸ¤”?'.

In all these unconscious interactions, we take a lot of the reality for granted. We don't think the lamppost will bent when we put our shoulder against it, or that the chair in the bus will prove unable to carry our weight. In a sense, the lamppost or the chair *disappear* in their daily use: the objects we use in this sense can be said to be *absent* in their objectivity â€“ they have become *transparant*.

One could say that these unconsious interactions and this taking for granted of reality forms out *frame of experience*: a frame that is in place once we know how our world works, a frame that has become an invisible background in our daily practice.

## Assignment

In this assignment you are asked to make this frame visible again. 

- Go outside to the public space and choose an object that lots of different people are using. 
- Take a few minutes to observe the way in which these people use this object, so that you get an understanding of the skillful manner this object is used; can you actually *observe* that this object has ceased to be present?
- Think about a manner in which the object can become present again. The easiest way is, of course, just to break it so that it is not functional anymore. But no doubt there are other, more interesting ways to make the object come to the fore in its objectivity.
- Realise your change and see how people react. 
- Document your work using foto's and film.
